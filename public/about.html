<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello my name is Martin! I'm a 33 year old aspiring web developer from Oslo, Norway.  <br /> I have no formal IT education, 
all my skills are acquired through self studies.<br /> My goal is to eventually reach the required skill level, 
to get a job as a full stack developer. </p>

<p>Currently i'm going through a full stack developer course on Udemy. When i'm done with this course, <br /> the next step is to continue
  with a course in ethical hacking,a programming class, and other relevant courses.
</p>

<p>I have a long journey ahead, but I truly believe that anything is possible if you work hard enough to reach your goals! <br />
